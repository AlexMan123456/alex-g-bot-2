# Select a Template

Please select the option that best describes your changes:

- [Breaking Change](?template=breaking_change.md) - For changes that may require users of the bot to drastically change their usage.
- [New Feature](?template=new_feature.md) - For changes that add a new feature to the bot.
- [Bug Fix](?template=bug_fix.md) - For changes that fix a bug in the bot.
- [Tooling Change](?template=tooling_change.md) - For changes to the bot's tooling (dependencies, devDependencies, configs...).
- [Documentation Change](?template=documentation_change.md) - For changes that affect the way that information about the bot is presented to users.
- [Refactor](?template=refactor.md) - For changes that change code quality and structure without affecting runtime behaviour.
- [Miscellaneous](?template=miscellaneous.md) - For changes that do not fit cleanly into any of the above categories.

In some cases, your pull request may be doing more than one of these. In this case, please select a template from the top-down.
For example, if you are introducing a new feature but also making changes to tooling, please select `New Feature` as that comes before tooling in the list.
